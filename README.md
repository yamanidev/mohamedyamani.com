## About

My website and blog where I document my journey by occasionally posting articles of my experiences, tips and thoughts. This is my personal space online.

## Done

- [x] Add canonical links to articles, since they were posted elsewhere initially. Edit: I misunderstood how canonicalization works. You provide the link you want to leverage among links of duplicate contents. Thus in my case, I should provide the canonical URLs of my website posts to the same posts on different platforms, not the other way around.
- [x] Add a 404 page.

## To do

- [ ] Improve the project structure semantically.
- [ ] Make sure ESLint is properly configured. What ticked me off about this was it not raising warnings to the lack of `rel="noreferrer"` when using `target="_blank"`
- [ ] Change the font into serif, I hate this childish font.
- [ ] Add RTL languages support as well as internationalization.
- [ ] Make all external links open a new tab.
- [ ] Get rid of fontawesome, it's too bloated.
- [ ] Improve SEO image previews. Check [opengraph](https://www.opengraph.xyz/) for this.
- [ ] Migrate the project to pnpm.
