## About

My website and blog where I document my journey by occasionally posting articles of my experiences, tips and thoughts. This is my personal space online.

## To do

- [ ] Improve the project structure semantically.
- [ ] Make sure ESLint is properly configured. What ticked me off about this was it not raising warnings to the lack of `rel="noreferrer"` when using `target="_blank"`
- [ ] Change the font into serif, I hate this childish font.
- [ ] Add RTL languages support as well as internationalization.
